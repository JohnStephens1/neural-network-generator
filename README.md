An older project I had worked on to challenge my understanding and ability.

Essentially a generator for neural networks, taking size and other hyperparameters as input and outputting a trainable model, all based on numerical operations rather than high level libraries.

Some sections are for the datasets I have tested the networks out with.


I've written this quite a few years ago, so a lot of the code isn't the cleanest, and especially the naming of variables leaves a lot to be desired. I might revise it at some point.
